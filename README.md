# 2023_ImageCLEFmed_GANs_submission_validators

## Task 1 format

<figure_id><delimiter><score>

    figure_id - I added all the IDs at the end of this email;
    delimiter - I'm not sure if we're going to use Aicrowd system or something else for validation, but I think it would be great if all participants can use the same delimiter that can be TAB or comma, but feel free to choose the one that you consider the best;
    score - indicates whether the image was used for training or not, and we can use 0 (not used) and 1 (used).
