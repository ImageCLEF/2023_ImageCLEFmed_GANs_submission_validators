# TESTS

This folder contains test submission files as well as a python test script which tests the evaluator.py script by providing it those test submission files.

The submission files consist of:
- At least 1 valid test submission file
- At least 1 valid test submission file for every SubmissionValidationException that evaluator.py can raise

You can run the tests with `python3 ./test.py`
