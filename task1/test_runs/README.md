# Tests

This folder contains test submission files as well as a python test script which tests the `validator.py` script by providing it those test submission files.

The submission files consist of:
- At least 1 valid test submission file
- At least 1 valid INVALID submission file for every SubmissionValidationException that `validator.py` can raise

You can run the tests with `python3 ./test.py`. Please make sure to change your current working directory to `./task1/test_runs` before.
